**This project was created to run [this account](https://twitter.com/NijiHolo_EN_ID).**

## Running modes
The bot may run in these modes:
* Catch-up (`c`): intended to run only once, scan all accounts for cross-company tweets and post them. Terminate when done posting all.
   - use `--auto-listen` to switch to listen mode when finished
* Listen (`l`): listens for tweets from list, sharing it if it's cross-company
* Command-line (`cmd`): an interactive mode for manual control (drops into Python interpretor)

## Extra TODOs
* Fix main post's quote tweet formatting
* Fix mentions not showing when a standard TalentTweet is created

**This project was created for the spirit of entertainment and in the name of unity.**
